# Final project 2
A stroke occurs when there is a block in the blood supply to the brain or a blood vessel in the brain bursts. Knowing the risk factors of a stroke can help doctors better identify what patients may be at a higher risk of a stroke.

The dataset provides information on 4,909 patients with 12 variables:
•	Id
•	Gender (Male, Female, Other)
•	Age
•	Hypertension/High Blood Pressure (1 if yes, 0 if no)
•	Heart Disease (1 if yes, 0 if no)
•	Ever Married (Yes, No)
•	Work Type (Private, Self-employed, Government Job, Children, Never Worked)
•	Residence Type (Urban, Rural)
•	Average Glucose Level
•	BMI
•	Smoking Status (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, unknown)
•	Stroke (1 if yes, 0 if no)

Using this dataset, we want to create a model to determine which specific variables are useful to predict those who had a stroke.
